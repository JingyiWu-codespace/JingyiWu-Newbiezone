- 👋 Hi, I’m @JingyiWu
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of things, sports, music, calligraphy, biking, delicious food, nature.....
- 🌱 I’m currently learning knowledge related to the CS field, I am a beginner at this, so I will update my exercise code to force me to exercise code frequently.
- 💞️ I’m looking to some online friends who have the same mind as me, to get positive progress in CS, we can do this, and finally find our dream job!!
- 📫 if you want to be friends with me, you could send an email to me.

Life is short and unpredictable, therefore it's important to try to find happiness every day.
